summary: Tech writer job ladders should include aspects of product management.
---

We tech writers typically have a deep understanding of our products. I've been
at this career long enough to know that, sometimes, producing a doc is just
putting a band-aid on a problem. Sometimes, it's better to just advocate for
a change in the product, so that the doc becomes unnecessary.

In my opinion, this type of work should be officially acknowledged and
rewarded in tech writer job ladders.
