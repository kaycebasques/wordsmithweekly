summary: Make all the things interactive.

A while back I advocated for interactive API references. I found a site
that does just that:

[http://www.javascripture.com/Blob][example]

[example]: https://wordsmithweekly.com/blog/the-fourth-doc-type

It doesn't look like it's being maintained, though, which is a pity.

I would go a step further by giving the readers the signature of each
function, but challenging them to figure out how to use the function
themselves to achieve a certain goal. See [The Fourth Doc
Type](/blog/the-fourth-doc-type) for more on this "homework"-based approach
to documentation.

In general, my main message to my fellow technical writers is: let's think
about how to add more interactivity to our docs. Obviously, each product
has its own restraints and opportunities. So you'll have to get creative
with how you approach it.
