grammatical rule of quotation marks."

The first commandment of technical writing is "know thy audience".

My audience is software developers. When software developers see something
in double or single quotes, they interpret it as a literal string.

For this reason, ever since I've been a technical writer I've always hated
the grammatical rule about placing punctuation inside of quotes. For example:

<blockquote class="content__quote">
  Readers of Kayce's post about quotation grammar found it "boring,"
  "inane," and "a perfectly good waste of what is probably a good mind."
</blockquote>

When I see that, I interpret the readers as literally saying "boring," and
"inane,"... with the commas included. It's unclear to me whether all of the
readers literally said the exact same thing, i.e. "boring, inane, a
perfectly good waste of what is probably a good mind." or whether one said
"boring," while another said "inane,", etc. This is a silly example, but that
logical distinction could make a big difference in a technical document.

So that's why I always include the punctuation on the outside of my quotes,
like I did in the first sentence of this post.

One risk of this approach: I've encountered a small but fervent minority of
software developers who are excruciatingly precise with their language, which
includes following grammatical rules to a tee. I could be losing credibility
with those developers. They probably think that I don't know the rule, not
that I'm intentionally bucking it. It could also cause me grief if I'm up
for promotion or hire with an old guard of technical writers who strongly
enforce the old rule.
