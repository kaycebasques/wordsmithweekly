Google Chrome automatically updates every 6 weeks. The first time that
someone opens Chrome DevTools in a new version of Chrome, the
"What's New" release notes tab automatically pops up, highlighting
features and changes.

Clicking any of those highlights jumps you to that section of my [release
notes doc][RN].

Many people who use DevTools prefer to learn visually, so we also do a video
version of the release notes. I embed these videos at the top of the release
notes docs.

I'm considering embedding these videos directly into the "What's New" tab's
UI.
