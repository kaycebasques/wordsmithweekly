summary: "Technical writers, and the knowledge professions in general, are
in the business of education. How do we impart knowledge to another person
as quickly and effectively as possible? Here's what a scrappy businessman,
renowned for his intellect, might teach us about the topic."

  You probably know of Warren Buffett, but you may not know of Charlie Munger,
  Buffett's business partner.
  Charlie attributes much of his success to his lifelong dedication to learning
  and applying the "big ideas" from across the disciplines. That's no small
  feat, though. There are a lot of disciplines, and a lot of big ideas within
  those disciplines. What Charlie needed was an effective system for retaining
  and recalling all that knowledge. To find that system, Charlie pulled out
  the king of his big ideas: incentives.
</p>

Incentives make the world go round. If you want to understand
why something in society is working, or why it's miserably dysfunctional,
figure out the incentives that are causing it.

Finding the most effective educational system is simply a matter of finding
the field that has the best incentives for effective education. As the
clickbait articles say, "the answer may surprise you".

It's pilot school. When you're responsbile for teaching someone how to careen
a metal tube through the sky, with the lives of hundreds of innocent 
bystanders at stake, you're going to think long and hard about how to
effectively impart that knowledge.

With that said, here are the six elements of pilot school that make it so
effective, according to Charlie:

> 2. His knowledge of practically everything needed by pilots is not taught

> 4. His training time is allocated among subjects so as to minimize damage
>    from his later malfunctions; and so what is most important in his
>    performance gets the most training coverage and is raised to the highest
>    fluency levels.
> 5. "Checklist" routines are always mandatory for him.
> 6. Even after original training, he is forced into a special

>    prevent atrophy through long disuse of skills needed to cope with rare
>    and important problems.

I'll wrap this up with some thoughts on how these elements apply to
technical writing, or possible ways that we can start applying them.

* Comprehensive Education (#1)
  * Create a curriculum for users that explicitly defines what it takes to
    become fluent in a subject. This also serves as your own checklist for
    making sure that your curriculum is, indeed, comprehensive.
* Practice-Based Fluency (#2)
  * Make tutorials as interactive as possible.
  * In the spirit of "handling two or three intertwined hazards at once",
    organize docs according to the real-world tasks that users face.
  * Provide multiple tutorials for each topic. This is rarely done in our
    industry, but maybe it's time to take a look at this.
* Forward- And Reverse-Thinking (#3)
  * When figuring out what topics to document, think not only about what the
    user is trying to accomplish, but also what they are trying to avoid.
    * Example: Frontend developers use the Chrome DevTools Network panel
      to analyze page load speed. The user's goal, then, is to "make pages
      load faster". But you accomplish that by thinking in reverse, explaining
      how to spot things that are making the page slow (large images, ... TODO
* Checklist Routines (#5)
  * Preface the headings in your tutorials with "Step 1", "Step 2", and so
    on. Organize tasks and workflows into numbered-lists as much as possible.
* Knowledge-Maintenance Routines (#6)
  * I'm reminded of Duolingo... TODO
