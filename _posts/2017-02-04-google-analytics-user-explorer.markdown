A few weeks back, I was scheming up complicated tools for tracking how users
interact with my docs. My goal was to get a report on each user session: pages
visited, page interactions, etc.

Turns out Google Analytics already has this feature. It's called User Explorer.
You can access it at **Reporting** > **Audience** > **User Explorer**.

Some of the data seems wonky:

* Some of the user sessions report a total time of zero. Maybe time spent
  only accrues when the page is in focus? I.e. perhaps users are opening
  links to this site in new tabs, without bringing the pages in focus.
* Other sessions show numerous repeat views of the same page. Again, maybe this
  is because users view the page, go to another tab, and then go
  back to my page.

I'll report back as I learn more. Or, if you're a User Explorer guru, I'd like
to hear from you!

  this article to :)
