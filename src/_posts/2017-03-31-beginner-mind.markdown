summary: One way that mindfulness can benefit your tech writing.
---

I've been meditating and learning about mindfulness for 3 or 4 years now. The
benefits in my life in general are innumerable, but I thought I'd share
one way that it helps my tech writing in particular.

One way I've been taught to practice mindfulness is to experience life in
terms of past, present, and future. Focusing on the past and future can
be problematic, because people act as if they can control them. There's
nothing you can do to ever change the past, and the future doesn't
exist. You may think you have a strong grasp on the future, but just
reflect on how many times things have gone different than you expected.
Hence, whatever notions you have about the future don't actually exist.

The key to peace is to live in the present. And, by definition, if you're
*really* good at letting go of the past and the future, then you have no
preconceptions about what the present is supposed to be like. So living in
the present is like living every moment anew. You're like a child; you're
experiencing everything for the first time. Hence the phrase "beginner's mind".

Beginner's mind happens to be a wonderful tool when usability testing
my docs. The essence of usability testing is capturing unwritten assumptions.
We rely on genuine newbies to usability test our docs, because it's
logically impossible for them to bring unwritten assumptions when trying
out the docs. This is great for ensuring that your docs are functionally
correct, i.e. there's no missing steps, but perhaps not so great for
capturing conceptual gaps. Beginner's mind is a cool practice, because it
forces me to explicitly drop any notions I have about a topic. Of course,
that's not completely possible, but the other cool effect of mindfulness is
that I'm much more aware of each passing thought. So, I can capture my own
mental models much easier when working through a doc, because I'm on the
lookout for them.

Getting others to usability test your docs is invaluable; you can probably
never do enough of that. This is just a complementary strategy for
increasing your own effectiveness.

In short, beginner's mind is a way to drop my own accumulated knowledge and
usability test my doc as a newbie.
