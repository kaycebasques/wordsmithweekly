summary: Or, how I got my start.

This is a brief catalog of the life and times of Kayce, as they pertain to my
technical writing career.

High school was a rough time for me. It was mostly a time of hooliganism, with
a lot of anger and aimlessness. On the bright side, I got my partying years
out of my system early, so that I could focus on my studies in college.

I enrolled in community college straight out of high school and started to get
my act together. I had no idea what I wanted to do, but I figured a good
education would open up some doors.

One mindset that has served me well since community college is "try to learn
something from every experience." I developed this as a survival mechanism
while trying to get through a class with the worst teacher ever. The only
thing I learned from that class was "this is how to *not* teach a class."

A piece of advice for those of you still in school: you'd be surprised how
big of an impact showing up to class and being an enthusiastic participant
has on your GPA.

In community college I did a semester of journalism for the school newspaper.
Looking back, journalism is excellent preparation for technical writing. You
learn how to interview people, an essential soft skill in the field. And,
obviously, you write a lot, and start building a portfolio of published work.

I completed my general education courses on time and transferred to UC Berkeley
after two years at community college. I still had no idea what I wanted to do,
but I had a vague interest in how society works, so I went for a degree in
History.

Actually, I gamed the system a bit by applying under the Legal
Studies program, which had the highest admission rate, and then transferring
to History once I was in.

At Berkeley I continued to dedicate myself to my studies. My two biggest
regrets are:

* Taking myself too seriously, i.e. not being more social.
* Not doing more internships.

Boy, did I have a rough time landing a job out of college. I applied for
months. It eventually set in that I wasn't prepared for the work force.

One day, while perusing the Economist, I stumbled upon this website called
oDesk. The Economist described it as an online marketplace for work. Companies
post contracts in various fields, and then contractors bid on them.

I took whatever writing contracts I could get my hands on. I wrote
copy for some random realtor in Florida, product descriptions for a
hydroponics retailer, employee manuals, you name it.

On oDesk I noticed a pattern: the best paying jobs were in something called
"technical writing". I had no idea what that meant. Digging deeper, I saw that
all the gigs were related to the software industry.

So, I enrolled in night / online classes in community college to learn
the basics of computer science and programming.

I continued doing contracts for a few months after that, and then a family
friend called me out of the blue, saying that he heard I was doing technical
writing and that his startup could use my help.

I worked at that startup for almost three years. I took any work that they
would let me have. I created marketing graphics, wrote blog posts, did
some manual QA, and of course, wrote all of the developer docs for their
embedded system and web service APIs.

When I started there, they were writing their docs in MS Word. So, I also
got experience in building a docs website.

About two years in, Google cold-called me, saying that they saw my LinkedIn
profile, and thought I'd be a good fit. I actually thought that the startup
was a better learning environment for me at the time because I had complete
control and freedom over my domain. So I told the recruiter to
check back in a year.

Sure enough, after that year had passed, I was ready for a change. I
figured that I could benefit more by surrounding myself with other, more
experienced technical writers. So, I jumped onboard the ol' Google
spaceship, and here I am today!
