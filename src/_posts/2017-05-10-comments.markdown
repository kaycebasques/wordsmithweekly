summary: Just like source code, sometimes docs need comments, too.
---

Recently I was documenting an esoteric, complicated feature of the Chrome
DevTools UI. The source of my knowledge was a reply on the DevTools mailing
list from one of the DevTools engineers.

In the past I would have documented this feature without leaving a note by
myself about where I got the info. But then, somebody would file a bug on
that very section, claiming that it was incorrect. I would
go back to review the source but not be able to find it. Very frustrating.

So now, whenever I document a tricky section based on hard-to-find knowledge,
I just add a comment with a link back to the source.

    {% comment %}source: https://... {% endcomment %}

If I worked on a big writer team with many hands touching the docs, this
approach could also be useful for shared resources. For example, if there's a
diagram in the doc, I could include a comment with a link to the source file.
