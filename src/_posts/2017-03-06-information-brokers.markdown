summary: How I think about the core job responsibilities of tech writers.
---

As a tech writer, I've always viewed my role as the connection between
engineers and users. As tech writers we have two core responsibilites:

1. Communicate workflows, best practices, and features to users, on behalf
   of engineers.
2. Communicate needs and wants to engineers, on behalf of users.

My challenge to you is to think about not only how you are meeting
responsibility #1, but also #2. Responsibility #2 is the underlying theme
of my previous posts on [Inline feedback](/blog/inline-feedback) and
[Analyzing Docs Journeys With Google Analytics User
Explorer](/blog/google-analytics-user-explorer). It's also the reason why
I consider community engagement, e.g. answering support questions about
your product, to be a core job duty of tech writers.
