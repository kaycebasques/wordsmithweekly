summary: That is the pedantic question.

In the Chrome DevTools docs, I write a lot of instructions revolving
around GUI elements: buttons, text boxes, etc.

A common practice is to always bold GUI elements. I
like this practice when giving instructions:

<blockquote class="content__quote">Click the <b>Network</b> tab.</blockquote>

Because it naturally maps the user's attention to the text that they are
searching for in the GUI. But I'm not as sold on this practice when I'm
discussing the GUI element in non-instructional contexts:

<blockquote class="content__quote">The <b>Network</b> tab lists requests.</blockquote>

My issue with bolding the GUI element in the second scenario is that it
calls undue attention to the element. In many of these situations, the GUI
element doesn't really deserve any more attention than the rest of the text.

In short, my proposal is to bold GUI elements in instructional contexts
only. Of course, the downside is that this produces two different formattings
for the same element.

P.S. I know the correct verb is "embolden", but it's clunky and sounds
like something from medieval times.
