summary: What's in it for readers?
---

With [inline feedback](/blog/audience-analysis), I have a way to ask arbitrary
question to my readers, in order to learn more about them, and ultimately
improve my docs to reflect my true audience's needs.

The thing I'm currently wrestling with is how to make inline feedback
engaging for my readers. Currently, I just give them an honest request for
help: I tell them that the data helps me understand them more, so that I
can make the docs match their needs. But I don't know if that's enough. Or,
rather, I wonder if there's clever ways to make readers *happy* to engage.

One idea that my manager had yesterday is to expose the results in the
response. In other words, when you respond, you get to see how everyone else
responded, too. Twitter does this with their polls, and I personally find it
to be quite rewarding.

Another idea is to tailor the doc based on their response. For example, suppose
I ask "how much experience do you have with the Performance panel?" at the
top of a tutorial on the Performance panel. I can offer to tailor the doc
based on their response. In other words, if someone says they have zero
experience, then I can offer a version of the doc that provides more
explanation. If they say they have a lot of experience, I can offer a
drastically concise version.
